"Indestructible"

he he
he he
he he

Another mission, the powers have called me away
Another time to carry the colors again
My motivation, an oath I've sworn to defend
To win the honor of coming back home again
No explanation will matter after we begin
Unlock the dark destroyer that's buried within
My true vocation, and now my unfortunate friend
You will discover a war you're unable to win

I'll have you know
That I've become
Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side, a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible
Master of war

Another reason, another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered, now for me to light
My dedication to all that I've sworn to protect
I carry out my orders without a regret
My declaration, embedded deep under my skin
A permanent reminder of how it began
No hesitation when I am commanded to strike
You need to know that you're in for the fight of your life

You will be shown
How I've become
Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side, a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible
Master of war

I'm
Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side, a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I am indestructible
Indestructible

Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side, a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible
Master of war

"Inside The Fire"

Devin
Won't go to heaven
She's just another lost soul,
About to be mine again
Leave her
we will receive her
It is beyond your control
will you ever meet again

Devin
One of eleven
Who had been rendered unwhole
As a little child,
she was taken
and then forsaken
you will remember it all
Let it fill your mind again

[Chorus:]
Devin lies beyond this portal
take the word of one immortal
Give your soul to me
For eternity
release your life
to begin another time with her
End your grief with me
there's another way
release your life
take your place inside the fire with her

Sever
Now and forever
you're just another lost soul about to be mine again
see her, you'll never free her
you must surrender it all
If you'd like to meet again

Fire
For your desire
As she begins to turn cold for the final time
you will shiver
till you deliver
you will remember it all
Let it fill your mind again

[Chorus]

Take it away, yeah!

Give your soul to me
For eternity
release your life
to begin another time with her
End your grief with me
there's another way
release your life
take your place inside the fire with her

Devin
One of eleven
Who had been rendered unwhole
As a little child
she was taken,
and then forsaken
you will remember it all
Let it fill your mind again, man

"Deceiver"

You've been caught in a lie!!
You can't deny it!

So let the war begin
You're far from innocent
Hell I just don't know where it will end
You are the one to blame
You made a habit of
Fucking up my life (ow!)

Another fallacy
Is laid in front of me
Now I just don't know
What to believe
Another animal
Sent to devour what-
Ever's left inside

[Chorus:]
I know now!
It's all been a lie
And I'll never come to know why
Awoke to discover
You leaving me now
It's all been a lie
I don't ever want to know why
You've mastered the art of
Deceiving me now.

A mortal enemy
Has been revealed in me
How come I wasn't able to see
Another vampire
Getting their fix from
Sucking up my life (OW!)
An evil entity
Had taken hold of me
Ripped out my heart and started to feed
I still remember when
I thought that all you were
Eating was my pride

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
This idiot won't let me go
Slowly penetrating the mind
I tell you now, my little puppet
You'll suffer me
You don't want to let me go
Till I've taken over your life
I'll ensure you survive
Little puppet don't die
Let me, let me die
Little puppet don't die
Let me, let me die
Little toy don't die

[Chorus]

What has come over me
What madness taken hold of my heart
To run away, the only answer
Pulling me away
To fall upon the night
The source of my recovery
Sweet shadow taking hold of the light
Another day has been devoured
Calling me away, begging the question
Why

For saving me from all they've taken
Letting my armor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over now
On a path to take it all away
There can be no better way of knowing

[Chorus]
In a world beyond controlling
Are you going to deny the savior
In front of your eyes
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you going to remain a slave for
The rest of your life
Give into the night

This self discovery
Redemption taking hold of my mind
A serenade of haunting voices
Calling me away
To feast upon the night
The source of my Felicity
Dark maiden taking hold of my hand
Lead me away from hibernation
Strong and unafraid
Never a question why

For saving me from all they've taken
Letting my armor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over now
I'm about to take it all away
There can be no better way of knowing

[Chorus]
In a world beyond controlling
Are you going to deny the savior
In front of your eyes
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you going to remain a slave for
The rest of your life
Give into the night

[Guitar Solo]

Give in to the night

[Chorus]
In a world beyond controlling
Are you going to deny the savior
In front of your eyes
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you going to remain a slave for
The rest of your life
Give into the night

Night [x3]
Give into the Night
Night [x3]
Give into the Night [x2]


"Perfect Insanity"

Ah ah ah ah ah aooo

Come inside and be afraid
Of this impressive mess I've made
If you take a look now you will find

I have thrown away my vice
Done away with paradise
See what's going on inside my mind
Please let me out
Please let me out
Please let me

Branded like an animal
I can still feel them burning my mind
I do believe that you made your message clear
I think I am losing my mind
I think I am losing my mind
Deprivating, isolating all that I feel
Leaving me with images I know are not real
Are those words of condemnation that I hear
I think I am losing my mind
I think I am losing my

Come inside now, I implore
Do you think you can restore
The crucial pieces missing from my brain
What seems to be the matter dear
Why do you cry and shake with fear
I've only had the best dub me insane.
Please let me out
Please let me out
Please let me

Branded like an animal
I can still feel them burning my mind
I do believe that you made your message clear
I think I am losing my mind
I think I am losing my mind
Deprivating, isolating all that I feel
Leaving me with images I know are not real
Are those words of condemnation that I hear
I think I am losing my mind
I think I am losing my mind

I Don't know how much I can take
The secret thoughts inside me wake
I've lost what was within me
Oh sweet insanity

I don't know how much I can take
The secret thoughts inside me wake
I've lost what was within me
Oh sweet insanity

Now I try again to find
The thing that was my mind
Behold the undersigned
Who said I've lost my mind

Try again to find
The thing that was my mind
Behold the undersigned
Who said I've lost my mind

I've lost my mind
I've lost my mind
I've lost my mind
I've lost my mind
I've lost my mind
I've lost my mind
I've lost my mind
I've lost my mind
I've lost
Mind
I've lost my mind
I've lost my mind
I've lost my mind
I've lost my mind
I've lost my mind
I've lost my mind
I've lost my mind
I've lost my mind

"Haunted"

You're broken, so am I
I'm better off alone
No one to turn to and nothing to call my own
Outspoken, so am I
Explosive words that your world wouldn't understand
Turn away again

You're beaten, so am I
I've got a heart of stone
No medication can cure what has taken hold
You're hurting, so will I
When I awake and remember why I've been running from your

World
Dishonored by your world
Your world
I'm haunted by your world

My blood is cold as ice
Or so I have been told
Show no emotion, and it can destroy your soul
Another sacrifice
To a tormentor your world wouldn't understand
Turn away again

You're angered, so am I
A thousand fires burn
A land of darkness from which I cannot return
You're aching, so will I
When I awake and discover that I have been damaged by your

World
Dishonored by your world
Your world
I'm haunted by your world

(Never will I be welcomed
Amongst the heartless monsters you surround yourself with
Feeding off the pain and misfortune of others
A maniacal unit of sub-human parasites
Warped into a feeding frenzy with the smell of fresh blood
Open your eyes and see the creatures for what they are
A swirling mess of hatred and envy
Don't be naive enough to think you're unaffected
The conversion has already begun...)

You're frightened, so am I
A world of demons wait
Watching the movements and filling my heart with hate
You're burning, so will I
When I awake and discover how I have been ravaged by your

World
Dishonored by your world
Your world
I'm haunted by your world

"Enough"

(We don't want them, we want everything)
(We've chosen to want everything)

We don't want them, who want everything
We've stolen in this suffering
And we told them to want everything
But use caution in what you believe
And the haunted, deny everything
Controlling in this suffering
When they're broken, and lost everything
They're so much easier to lead

Take their hope away
Take their life away
Leave them nothing left inside

[Chorus:]
When your own have died
When there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen
Is that enough?
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
With every moment
Is that enough?

(Without warning, we take everything)
Without warning, we take everything
Undaunted in this suffering
The dark forces surround everything
Make it impossible to see

Take their hope away
Take their life away
Leave them nothing left inside

[Chorus]

Haven't they suffered enough
Haven't we suffered enough
Haven't they suffered enough, they're damaged more than they can bear
Haven't they suffered enough
Haven't we suffered enough
Haven't they suffered enough, they're damaged more than they can bear

Did they even have a reason why
Countless sons and daughters had to die
Can you even comprehend the pain

Tell me when your...

[Chorus]

Own have died
When there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen
Is that enough?
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
With every moment
Is that enough?

[Chorus]

When your own have died (own have died)
When there's no more pride (no more pride)
When your soul is frozen
Is that enough? (is that enough?)
When your heart is broken
A thousand times (a thousand times)
With every moment
Is that enough?

"The Curse"

Marked for demolition, I'm
Just a time bomb ticking inside
No hope for the hopeless,
I can see the pieces all laid out in front of me

No point even asking why
Couldn't help even if you tried
Step aside or you might just be the next contestant
To feel the Brutality!

Devastation, Obliteration
Are all to the point of Exacerbation
There's no explaining my situation now,
Why does this shit keep happening to me?

I've held on too long just to let it go now,
Will my inner strength get me through it some how
Defying the curse that has taken hold
Never surrender,
I'll never be overcome!

Too dark for forgiveness, I
Can't seem to do anything right
When I try to rebuild I see my humble shelter
Just fall to the ground again

Object to the evil eye
No point to let anyone try
Take heed my friend lest you be torn asunder
Like all that's become of me

Descimation, Disintegration
Now beyond the point of imagination,
There's no explaining my situation now
Why does this shit keep happening to me?

I've held on too long just to let it go now,
Will my inner strength get me through it some how
Defying the curse that has taken hold
Never surrender,
I'll never be overcome!

[Guitar Solo]

I've held on too long just to let it go now,
Will my inner strength get me through it some how
Defying the curse that has taken hold
Never surrender,
I'll never be overcome!

I've held on too long just to let it go now, (Will my inner strength)
Will my inner strength get me through it some how (Defying the curse)
Defying the curse that has taken hold
Never surrender,
I'll never be overcome!

"Torn"

I learned how to fall today, didn't think it would kill you
To settle the debt I thought never would be paid
Found out I was wrong today, too weak to continue
One final defense to fall
Still unbroken

Now I am torn, thought it was over this time
And we know there's still a fire inside
And we know, and we know
We're gonna let it burn
Let it burn
Till the image fades away

Knew there was a price to pay, didn't think it would thrill you
To witness the fallen one shattered and ashamed
No I'm not the only one yearning to fulfill you
Unwilling to risk it all
Still uncertain

Now I am torn, thought it was over this time
And we know there's still a fire inside
And we know, and we know
We're gonna let it burn
Let it burn
Till the image fades away

Yeah!!

[Guitar solo]

Now I am torn, thought it was over this time
And we know there's still a fire inside
And we know, and we know

That I am torn (torn)
Thought it was over this time
And we know (know)
There's still a fire inside
And we know, and we know
We're gonna let it burn
Let it burn
Till the image fades away

"Criminal"

(Malevolent criminal, I)
(When the vision paints my mind)
(Cross the invisible line)
(And you'll be paid in kind)
[REPEAT]

HIT IT!
HA HA
HA HA
HA HA

Criminal
The suffering
It makes me think like a
Criminal
The suffering
When we're alone
Criminal
The suffering
It makes me feel like a
Criminal
The suffering
When we're alone

Typical enough for me
That I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
TO bury my vision

The hunger coming over me
As I learn to hide the agony
To make a final remedy
To close the door once and for all

[CHORUS]
In a world that I don't want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be free from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don't tell me I can not go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end

(it seems the whole experience is)
Terrible and crippling
The pain is much more than
Physical beyond belief
When we're alone

Typical enough for me
And I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
To make this decision

Despair has fallen over me
No way to hide the agony
Embracing my calamity
To save myself once and for all

[CHORUS]

Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to call me motherfucker
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to say it doesn't matter

Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to call me motherfucker
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to say it doesn't matter now

Now you wanna know
Now you wanna name
Now you wanna place
Now you wanna time
Now you want it all

Now you wanna know
Now you wanna name
Now you wanna place
Now you wanna time
Now you want it all
Now

In a world that I don't want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be free from all of this
I want you to quicken my end

Don't tell me I can not go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end

Don't say that it isn't so
I'm on a path that you'll never comprehend
Set me free from all of this
I need you to quicken my end

"Divide"

Go!

I want to tear a big hole in what is to be,
To end all this infatuation with unity,
I'm seeking my salvation alone again,
I never needed to be one of you anyway
Don't wanna be another player losing in this game
I'm trying to impress upon you
We're not the same
My own individuality is so unique,
I'm one impressive motherfucker
Now, wouldn't you say

[Chorus:]
(Break apart and)
Divide, divide, divide, divide
You might say that I'm the last man standing now,
And though you try, you'll never find a way to break me
You might say that I'm sick of being lost in the crowd,
I hear the sirens but they're never gonna take me

I am a little more provocative then you might need,
It's your shock and then your horror on which I feed
So can you tell me what exactly does freedom mean,
If I'm not free to be as twisted as I wanna be
Don't wanna be another player losing in this game
I'm trying to impress upon you
We're not the same
My psychotic mentality is so unique
I'm one aggressive motherfucker
Now, wouldn't you say

[Chorus]

(They won't take me)

Break, break, break, break
(Break apart and divide)
Break, break, break, break
(Break apart and divide)
Break, break, break, break
(Break apart and divide)
Break, break, break, break
(Break apart and divide, divide, divide)
Break apart and...

[x2]
Divide, divide, divide, divide
Divide, divide, break apart and divide
Divide, divide, divide, divide
Divide, divide, break apart and

Divide, divide, divide, divide (you might say that I'm the last man standing now)
Divide, divide, break apart and divide

Divide, divide, divide, divide (and though you try, you'll never find a way to break me)
Divide, divide Divide Divide

"Façade"

No one knows just what has become of her
Shattered doll, desperate
Oh so innocent and delicate
But too damn obdurate
And obstinate to let go

Broken down, hurt again, it never ends
Frightened and trembling
Did she fall again? An accident?
Her eyes encircled in black again
I can't believe that she's still with him

For how long will you try?
How long until you walk away?
Your façade can't disguise
The fact that you're in misery

Look inside see what has become of her
Hiding within again
Can she pick herself up again?
It's just too difficult and arduous to let go

Homicide flashes through her mind again
No more pain, take control
If he raises his hand again
She'll find her freedom in killing him
The world will see that she's had enough

For how long will you try?
How long until you walk away?
Your façade can't disguise
The fact that you're in misery

For how long will you try?
How long until you walk away?
From the look in your eyes
I know you bleed internally

For how long will you deny?
How long until you walk away?
Your façade can't disguise
The fact that you're in misery

For how long will you try?
How long until you walk away?
From the look in your eyes
I know you bleed internally

Broken down, hurt again
It never ends

"Run"

Run and hide again
I want to wait this time
Don't wonder why you can't clear this final sin
You know this story was over before it began
This is a battle
You're not gonna win
Welcome to the end

I've spent a lifetime planning out your destruction
You're never gonna witness another day
Alone in my mind, planning out your destruction, with no other function
You really don't know how long I've waited for your destruction
I'm telling you, you just can't get away
A whole lifetime planning out your destruction, with no other function
You really don't know

You better run

Ask me why again, nowhere to go this time
Revenge will be mine again
Say goodbye, my friend
Don't run away this time and die like a man

There is no escape from my plan
Welcome to the end

I've spent a lifetime planning out your destruction
You're never going to witness another day
Alone in my mind, planning out your destruction, with no other function
You really don't know how long I've waited for your destruction
I'm telling you, you just can't get away
A whole lifetime planning out your destruction, with no other function
You really don't know

There is no reprieve
You don't dare to look in my eyes
We'll turn their gaze away in time
You better run!

I've spent a lifetime planning out your destruction
You're never going to witness another day
Alone in my mind, planning out your destruction, with no other function
You really don't know how long I've waited for your destruction
I'm telling you, you just can't get away
A whole lifetime planning out your destruction, with no other function
You really don't know

Welcome to the end

Run and hide again
I want to wait this time
Don't wonder why you can't clear this final sin
You know the story was over before it fucking began

"Parasite"

You've got nowhere to hide, and all bullshit aside
You've committed a terrible crime
You've stepped over the line and you'd better be running for your life
Fucked over again, I even called you a friend
A mistake I won't be repeating
I just don't understand how you can even continue to deny

You know why
(You don't remember why)
Don't you pretend that you don't know why
(You fucking parasite)
Because you're living through association that has been getting you high
You sell your soul for just a taste of my life

Now what a surprise, to discover the lies
You'll be telling again in no time
You just don't realize they'll come back and be fucking up your life
In trouble again, I just don't understand
This whole pattern that keeps repeating
You know you'll do it again and admit you can step into the light

You know why
(You don't remember why)
Don't you pretend that you don't know why
(You fucking parasite)
Because you're living through association that has been getting you high
You sell your soul for just a taste of my life

Determination has been running on high
No control, for just a taste of my life

Because your association has been getting you high
You sell your soul for just a taste of my life

Determination has been running on high
No control, for just a taste of my life

For just a taste of my life

You've got nowhere to hide and all bullshit aside
You've committed a terrible crime
You've stepped over the line and you'd better be running for your life

"Midlife Crisis"
(originally by Faith No More)

Go on and wring my neck
Like when a rag gets wet
A little discipline
For my pet genius
My head is like a lettuce
Go on and dig your thumbs in
I cannot stop giving
I'm thirty-something

Sense of security
Like pockets jingling
Midlife crisis
Suck ingenuity
Down through the family tree

You're perfect, yes, it's true
But without me you're only you (you're only you)
Your menstruating heart
It ain't bleedin' enough for two

It's a midlife crisis
It's a midlife crisis...

What an inheritance
The salt and the Kleenex
Morbid self attention
Bending my pinky back
A little discipline
A donor by habit
A little discipline
Rent an opinion

Sense of security
Holding blunt instrument
Midlife crisis
I'm a perfectionist
And perfect is a skinned knee

You're perfect, yes, it's true
But without me you're only you (you're only you)
Your menstruating heart
It ain't bleeding enough for two

It's a midlife crisis...
It's a midlife crisis...

You're perfect, yes, it's true
But without me you're only you
Your menstruating heart
It ain't bleeding enough for two [repeat until fade]
