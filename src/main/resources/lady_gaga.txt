"Diamond Heart"

Young, wild, American
Lookin' to be somethin'
Out of school go-go'n
For a hundred or two
Some asshole broke me in
Wrecked all my innocence
I'll just keep go-go'n
And this dance is on you

One, five, ten, lay a million on me
Before the end of this song

Young, wild, American
C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?
Rain on me a million
I'm not flawless, but I gotta diamond heart

Oh, I
I might not be flawless, but you know
I gotta diamond heart
Oh, I
I might not be flawless, but you know
I gotta diamond heart

Young, wild, American
Head full of Jameson
Girl's playin' bad 'cause it doesn't pay to be good
A cruel king made me tough
Daddy's girl's never good enough
I'll just keep go-go'n
'Cause this dance is on you

One, five, ten, lay a million on me
Before the end of this song

Young, wild, American
C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?
Rain on me a million
I'm not flawless, but I gotta diamond heart

Oh, I
I might not be flawless, but you know
I gotta diamond heart
Oh, I
I might not be flawless, but you know
I gotta diamond heart

Good thing I know what I'm worth
Want a good thing, put the money down first
Better get a good look baby
'Cause soon I'm breaking out of here

Young, wild, American
C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?
Rain on me a million
I'm not flawless, but I gotta diamond heart

Oh, I
I might not be flawless, but you know
I gotta diamond heart
Oh, I
I might not be flawless, but you know
I gotta diamond heart

Diamond heart

"A-Yo"

Here we go!

I can't wait to smoke them all
Whole pack like Marlboro
Blow it in your face, blow it in your face
Blow it in your, blow it in your face

I can't wait to rev you up
Faster than you can say "Ferrari"
Tearin' up the gravel, watch you unravel
Now it's a party

Hey, I can't wait to cast my spell
Which one you'll never tell
'Cause I got it covered, city gravy southern
Got you drippin' like no other

Get off on me, my body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceilin'
Off on me, my body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceiling
A-YO, A-YO
We smokin' 'em all
A-YO, A-YO
We smokin' 'em all
A-YO, A-YO
We smokin' 'em all
A-YO, A-YO

I can't wait to blaze for real
Track burns like a road rail
Spin it in your face, spin it in your face
Play it in your, play it in your face

Can't wait to get you shook up
Faster than you can try to hate it
You can try to hate it, you can try to fake it
But baby, I laced it

Get off on me, my body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceilin'
Off on me, my body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceiling
A-YO, A-YO
Mirror on the ceiling
(We smokin' 'em all)
A-YO, A-YO
Mirror on the ceiling
(We smokin' 'em all)
A-YO, A-YO
Mirror on the ceiling

A-YO, A-YO
Aaaa-YO

(We smokin' 'em all)
A-YO A-YO

Get it da get it da get it get it
Get off on me, my body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceilin'
Off on me, my body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceiling

"Joanne"

Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven's not
Ready for you
Every part
Of my aching heart
Needs you more
Than the angels do

Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?

If you could
I know that you'd stay
We both know
Things don't work that way
I promised I
Wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin
And my voice gets thin

Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?

Honestly, I know where you're goin'
And baby, you're just movin' on
And I'll still love you even if I can't
See you anymore
Can't wait to see you soar

Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?


"John Wayne"

It's like, I just love a cowboy
You know
I'm just like, I just, I know, it's bad
But I'm just like
Can I just like, hang off the back of your horse
And can you go a little faster?!

3 am, mustang speedin'
Two lovers, headed for a dead end
Too fast, hold tight, he laughs
Runnin' through the red lights
Hollerin' over, rubber spinnin'
Big swig, toss another beer can
Too lit, tonight, prayin'
On the moonlight

Every John is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne

Baby let's get high, John Wayne
Baby let's get high, John Wayne

Blue collar and a red-state treasure
Love junkie on a three-day bender
His grip, so hard, eyes glare
Trouble like a mug shot
Charged up, 'cause the man's on a mission
1-2 ya, the gears are shiftin'
He called, I cried, we broke
Racin' through the moonlight

Every John is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne

Baby let's get high, John Wayne
Baby let's get high, John Wayne

So here I go
To the eye
Of the storm
Just to feel your love
Knock me over
Here I go
Into our love storm

Baby let's get high, John Wayne
Baby let's get high, John Wayne

"Dancin' In Circles"

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

I lay around, touch myself to pass the time
I feel down, I wish you were mine
I close my eyes
Take a breath and I picture us in a place
I can't recognize

In the fire I call your name out (call your name out, call your name out)
Up all night tryin' to rub the pain out

I'm singin'
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
I'm singin' dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

I fool myself
Swirl around as if I'm someone else
Your hands are mine
I do a trick
Pretend that I am you until it clicks
I come alive
Come alive

In the fire I call your name out (call your name out, call your name out)
Up all night tryin' to rub the pain out (rub the pain out)

I'm singin'
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
I'm singin' dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

Hurts inside, but not this time
All the things that are on my mind
Vanish as I touch myself
Call out loud for you
Oh, can you hear me singin'?

Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
I'm singin'
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

"Perfect Illusion"

Tryin' to keep control
Pressure's takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion

I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm wakin' up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)

(Where are you?
Cause I can't see you)
It was a perfect illusion
(But I feel you watchin' me
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy)

(Where are you?
Cause I can't see you)
It was a perfect illusion
(But I feel you watchin' me
But I feel you watchin' me)
Illusion
(But I feel you watchin' me)
Mistaken for love
(Where were you
Cause I can't see
But I feel you watchin' me)
Mistaken for love
(Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy)
Mistaken for love
(In a modern ecstasy
In a modern ecstasy)

I'm over the show
Yeah at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Ohhhh
You were a perfect illusion
Ohhhh
It was a perfect illusion
It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
It was a perfect illusion, (illusion) (illusion)
It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
You were so perfect
You were a, you were a perfect illusion


"Million Reasons"

You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worse seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you've given me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Giving me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you've given me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worse seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Aye-eee-ayeee-ay-ayyee
Oh, baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Aye-eee-ayeee-ay-ayyee
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worse seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather

I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay aye eee ayeee


"Sinner's Prayer"

I came down the mountain
Draggin' our love affair
Put on a pretty little number
I'm wearing you still
It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast
Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me
He has a funny way saying forever too fast
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp
For something he don't have
I get on my knees and beg you

Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold

Got a baby sister who looks just like me
She wants nothing more than a man to please
Maybe she's in too deep
Her love for him ain't cheap
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece
From Fulton Street
The man's got a gift for getting what he wants
He's thirsty when he drinks
Gets on the brink, and throws her off
I get on my knees and beg you

Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold

I can carry you, but not your ghosts
Wish I had the faith, but I don't know, oh

Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold


"Come To Mama"

Everybody's got to love each other
Stop throwin' stones at your sisters and your brothers
Man, it wasn't that long ago we were all living in the jungle
So why do we gotta put each other down
When there's more than enough love to g-g-go around?

Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out

Dude in a lab coat and a man of God
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
Fought over prisms and a forty-day flood
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
Well, I say rainbows did more than they've ever done
So why do we gotta fight over ideas?
We're talkin' the same old shit after all of these years

Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out
Oh, come tomorrow
Who are you gonna follow?
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out

Psychic guru catches minnows in the harbor
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
Everyone tells him he should work a little harder
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
(Hey, man, get to work, catch up)
They all tell you that freedom must be bought
But, baby, he's already caught them
So why do we gotta tell each other how to live?
The only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in

Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out
Oh, come tomorrow
Who are you gonna follow?
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out

Come to mama (Come onto me)
Come on mama
Come on mama
Come on mama

'Cause I wanna be there
I wanna be there for you
I wanna be there

Why do we gotta tell each other how to live?
The only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in
Why do we gotta tell each other how to live?
Look what that rainbow did


"Hey Girl"
(feat. Florence Welch)

Hey girl, can you hear me?
Are you holding out your heart?
Hey girl, do you feel me?
Sometimes I go too far
Hey girl, it ain't easy
I know it's pulling me apart
But darlin', don't you leave me
Baby, don't you leave me

Hey girl, hey girl
We can make it easy if we lift each other
Hey girl, hey girl
We don't need to keep on one-in' up another
Hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl
If you lose your way
Just know that I got you
Just know that I got you

Lady is it lonely?
I been callin' out your name
Tell me that you need me
'Cause I need you just the same
Everyday a heartache
I'm just tryin' to keep it sane
But I know you believe me
Baby don't you leave me

Hey girl, hey girl
We can make it easy if we lift each other
Hey girl, hey girl
We don't need to keep on one-in' up another
Hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl
If you lose your way
Just know that I got you

Help me hold my hair back
Walk me home 'cause I can't find a cab
And we dance down the bowery
Held hands like we were 17 again
And then it's 4am
The sun is creepin' up again
Don't you leave me
Oh, darling don't you leave me

Hey girl, hey girl
We can make it easy if we lift each other
Hey girl, hey girl
We don't need to keep on one-in' up another
Hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl
If you lose your way
Just know that I got you

Just know that
Just know that I got you
Just know that
Just know that
Just know that
Help me hold my hair back
Walk me home 'cause I can't find a cab
And we dance down the bowery
Held hands like we were 17 again

"Angel Down"

I confess I am lost
In the age of the social
On our knees, take a test
To be lovin' and grateful

Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
But the people just stood around

I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

Doesn't everyone belong
In the arms of the sacred
Why do we pretend we're wrong?
Has our young courage faded?

Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
Why do people just stand around?

I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

Save that angel
Hear that angel
Catch my angel
Save that angel
Hear that angel
Catch my angel
Hear that angel
Hear that angel
Catch my angel
Save that angel
Hear that angel
Catch my angel
Hear that angel
Catch my angel


"Grigio Girls"

I was 23
She was 35
I was spiralling out
And she was so alive
A Texas girl real strong
Taught me this strong song
So when I start to bawl
She says, "let your teardrops fall"

All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Pour your heart out
Watch your blues turn gold
All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world
Oh, oh, make it all make sense
Oh, oh, does it all make sense?
Oh, oh, make it all make sense

Sisters never pack up
We always run back love
Seven years ago
I said you'd make it so
Sonja was Joanne's friend
Tough girls on the mend
So when I'm feeling small
I toss that cork and call

All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Pour your heart out
Watch your blues turn gold
All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world
Oh, oh, make it all make sense
Oh, oh, make it all make sense
Oh, oh, does it all make sense?

So we'll turn on a bachelorette
Dye Ashley's hair red
And then we'll have our sixth
Spice girl in this bitch

All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Pour your heart out
Watch your blues turn gold
All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world

All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Gather 'round now
Watch your blues turn gold
All the Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls
Keep it real cold
'Cause it's a fired up world


"Just Another Day"

"Yeah man, play that New York drum, Homer
Show 'em how we do it! Downtown"

Just another way to prove I love you
And it's hard today
I'll lay back in my chair and find a way
And when you say that thing that you say
That makes me mad
I'll turn away, I'll turn away, I'll turn away

And think of different ways to keep my spirits up
And choreograph hours with playful, joyous thoughts

We both know I could learn a thing or two
About relaxing, hey, I love you
And after all, it's just another day

Oh, I could use some two or three
Or other kind of ways to be
But today I won't be so hard on me
I'll walk alone down a different street
And smile at all the new strange I meet

And pick up unique style, I'll kick around today
And create simple thoughts, I'll laugh in humble ways

We both know I could learn a thing or two
About behaving, but I love you
And after all, it's just another day

Come on, Mark

Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Newman

We both know I could learn a thing or two
About behaving, but I love you
And after all, it's just another day

And after all
It's just another day
